Hublot: The official timekeeper

Hublot has signed one of the most prestigious agreements in its history as the Official Timekeeper and Official Watch for the next two FIFA World Cup™ in 2010 and 2014.

This is the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup™ that a watchmaking brand becomes the Official FIFA Timekeeper having presence on the substitution board. To commemorate this substantial agreement, Hublot is unveiling the official licensed watch of the FIFA World Cup™: a timepiece reflecting the gold of the coveted FIFA World Cup Trophy! The case, bezel and dial are fashioned from pink gold, with a subtle tone-ontone drawing of the prestigious FIFA World Cup Trophy revealed at 6 o'clock. An illustration of the world’s most prestigious sports price is also engraved on the watch's solid gold case-back, as a symbol of the alliance between luxury and the world of football. Embellished by an alligator and rubber strap, and with a chic and sporty look, this exclusive automatic Classic Fusion model is available in just 100 numbered pieces.
